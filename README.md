# Effects-Reducers-Context
This is a demo project focused on providing a working example of a React application leveraging the useEffect and useReducer hooks as well as the Context API used to create a 'global state' to manage authorization.
I have added thorough notes breaking down each step of these concepts, most of which can be found in the Login.js file and the auth-context.js file.
The application itself does work and you can see these tools in 'effect', but the features are limited as that is the purpose: demonstrating these specific concepts and explaining how they work.

# Installation 
You can copy this repository and install the packages with npm i to use this application with npm start and look through the notes to help clarify processes.
